Description: Emacs minor mode for d20 tabletop roleplaying games
 org-d20 is a minor mode for Emacs’ Org-mode for GMs running games whose rules
 centre around rolling d20s. It should be useful for Dungeons and Dragons 3rd,
 4th and 5th editions, Paizo’s Pathfinder, and d20 System games like d20
 Modern.
 .
 The idea is that you’re already keeping your campaign notes in an Org-mode
 file. This minor mode does useful things for you while you are visiting that
 buffer. For example,
 .
 - rolling dice, with 5e’s advantage and disadvantage displayed in case those
   are needed;
 - tracking combat turns and rounds right next to your existing description of
   the monsters and the terrain.
